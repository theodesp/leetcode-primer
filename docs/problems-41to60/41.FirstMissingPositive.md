# 21. Merge Two Sorted Lists

[TOC]

You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists list1 and list2.

Merge the two lists in a one sorted list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

Return the head of the merged linked list.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: list1 = [1,2,4], list2 = [1,3,4]
Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: list1 = [], list2 = []
Output: []
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: list1 = [], list2 = [0]
Output: [0]
```

**Constraints:**

```
* The number of nodes in both lists is in the range `[0, 50]`
* `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
* Both list1 and list2 are sorted in non-decreasing order.
```

## Problem Analysis

For returning the linked list result you can use a dummy node to hold the result.

As both linked lists are sorted already, you can iterate over both and add the smallest one on the result list. Then append the largest remaining list to the result.

Its better if you check if the current list node pointers are not null using `while (list1 && list2)` instead of `while (list1.next && list2.next)`.

## Solutions

### Nominal

This function assumes that the input linked lists are sorted in ascending order. It iterates through the nodes of both lists and adds the smaller of the two nodes to the result. When one of the lists is exhausted, the remaining nodes from the other list are added to the result.

Time complexity is $O(n+m)$ because it could touch all elements of both lists.
