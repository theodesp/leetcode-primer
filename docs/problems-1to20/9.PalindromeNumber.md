# 9. Palindrome Number

[TOC]

Given an integer x, return true if x is a
palindrome, and false otherwise.

**Note:**

- Only the space character ' ' is considered a whitespace character.
- Do not ignore any characters other than the leading whitespace or the rest of the string after the digits.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: x = 121
Output: true
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: x = 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
```

**Constraints:**

```
-2^31 <= x <= 2^31 - 1
```

## Problem Analysis

It is obvious that negative numbers always return false.

You can use the _7-ReverseInteger_ to calculate the reverse of the integer representation.

## Solutions

### Using Math

The obvious way to do this is to create a new integer that is the reverse of the original integer. We can then compare the original integer to the reversed integer, and return true if they are equal and false otherwise:

??? Show "Solution using Math"
`js title="PalindromeNumber.js"
    --8<-- "solutions/9-PalindromeNumber/PalindromeNumber.js"
    `

The time complexity of the function is linear, or $O(n)$, where n is the number of digits in the input number. This is because the function performs a constant amount of work for each digit of the input number.
