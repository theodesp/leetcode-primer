# 19. Remove Nth Node From End of List

[TOC]

Given the head of a linked list, remove the `nth` node from the end of the list and return its head.


**Example 1:**

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], n = 2
Output: [1,2,3,5]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: head = [1], n = 1
Output: []
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: head = [1,2], n = 1
Output: [1]
```

**Constraints:**

```
* `1 <= sz <= 30`
* `0 <= Node.val <= 100`
* `1 <= n <= sz`
```

## Problem Analysis

Note you can delete a node from a linked list if you have a pointer the previous node.

You need to make sure you don't accidentally return a pointer other than the head of the list.

Because you cannot access the list at index `n` from the last you need to find a way to put the pointer at position `list.length - n - 1` so you will be able to update the next pointer to point to the pointer ahead of it.

## Solutions

### Using Fast and Slow pointers

This function uses a technique called "two pointers" to solve the problem. It sets up two pointers (slow and fast) at the head of the linked list, and moves the fast pointer `n` steps ahead of the slow pointer. Then, it moves both pointers together until the fast pointer reaches the end of the linked list. At this point, the slow pointer is pointing at the `(n-1)th` node from the end, so we can remove the nth node by updating the next pointer of the `(n-1)th` node.
