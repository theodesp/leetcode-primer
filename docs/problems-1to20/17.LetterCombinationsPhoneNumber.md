# 17. Letter Combinations of a Phone Number

[TOC]

Given a string containing digits from 2-9 inclusive, return all possible letter combinations that the number could represent. Return the answer in any order.

A mapping of digits to letters (just like on the telephone buttons) is given below. Note that 1 does not map to any letters.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: digits = "23"
Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: digits = ""
Output: []
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: digits = "2"
Output: ["a","b","c"]
```

**Constraints:**

```
0 <= digits.length <= 4
```

## Problem Analysis

Note that each letter used, will unlock at least 3 digits multiplied by the rest of the existing ones. So for each letter pressed we need to calculate the letter combinations of those new letters with the ones that we already used so far.

This means that we need to use either recursion or a double loop to iterate over the existing letter combinations.

## Solutions

### Brute Force

This function uses a for loop to iterate through all possible combinations of letters, and checks if each combination is valid by checking if it contains only the letters corresponding to the given digits. The numCombinations variable is used to determine the total number of combinations that need to be checked, and is calculated as 4 to the power of the number of digits (since each digit has 4 possible letters).

Verify that the algorithm is correct and especially the loop indices do not skip parts of the array. The time complexity of the algorithm is $O(4^n)+c$ as it represent the count of n, 4-letter combinations of a given number n.

### Canonical

This function uses a for loop to iterate through the digits in the input string. For each digit, it looks up the corresponding letters in the letterMaps object and generates new combinations by combining each letter with the existing combinations. The resulting combinations are stored in the result array, which is initialized to an array containing an empty string.

The following program shows how to implement this approach:

    `

In this approach, we use a for loop to iterate through the digits in the input string, and for each digit we generate new combinations by combining each of its letters with the existing combinations. Since each digit has 4 possible letters, the time complexity of this approach is $O(4^n)$.
